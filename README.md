> LIME for sepsis prediction model

This is a project of current research and trend of health informatics from Karolinska Institutet and Stockholm university. We are working on the model-agnostic interpretability of machine learning models with dataset from PhysioNet 2019 and/or MIMIC III.

## The participants are:
* **Alexandra** - [alex2010ru](https://github.com/alex2010ru) - 
* **Jintai Liu** - [LeooLeoo](https://github.com/LeooLeoo) - 
* **Nesa** - [nesaretnambarr](https://github.com/nesaretnambarr) - 
* **Tobias** - [tobiasblomberg](https://github.com/tobiasblomberg) - 


### The work consists of 3 stages:
- [x] machine learning model construction
- [x] LIME codes implementation
- [x] Interpretability evaluation
